# Question-Answering AI Agent

## About

This project aims to create a robust, intelligent AI Agent capable of automating various tasks. Our agent is designed following the PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) framework to ensure it's robust, scalable, and efficient.

### What is PEAS?

PEAS stands for Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors. It's a framework used to describe the various components of an intelligent agent:

- **Performance Measure**: How well is the agent doing in its environment
- **Environment**: Where the agent operates
- **Actuators**: What actions the agent can take
- **Sensors**: How the agent perceives its environment

## Features

- Modular Design
- OpenAI GPT-4 Integration
- Extensible and Customizable
