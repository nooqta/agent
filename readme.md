# Saiku (細工) The AI Agent

## About

This project aims to create a robust, intelligent AI Agent capable of automating various tasks. Our agent is designed following the PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) framework to ensure it's robust, scalable, and efficient.

### Why Saiku?

"Saiku" (細工) in Japanese refers to detailed or delicate work, symbolizing the intricate and intelligent workings of our AI agent. 

- **S**: Smart
- **A**: Artificial
- **I**: Intelligent
- **K**: Knowledgeable
- **U**: Unmatched

We chose a Japanese name to symbolize precision, innovation, and advanced technology, attributes highly respected in Japanese culture. Even though we are based in Tunisia, we believe in global collaboration and the universal appeal and understanding of technology.

### What is PEAS?

PEAS stands for Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors. It's a framework used to describe the various components of an intelligent agent:

- **Performance Measure**: How well is the agent doing in its environment
- **Environment**: Where the agent operates
- **Actuators**: What actions the agent can take
- **Sensors**: How the agent perceives its environment

## Features

- Modular Design
- OpenAI GPT-4 Integration
- Extensible and Customizable
