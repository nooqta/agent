# Saiku (細工) The AI Agent

## About

This project aims to create a robust, intelligent AI Agent capable of automating various tasks. Our agent is designed following the PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) framework to ensure it's robust, scalable, and efficient.

### Why Saiku?

"Saiku" (細工) in Japanese refers to detailed or delicate work, symbolizing the intricate and intelligent workings of our AI agent. 

- **S**: Smart
- **A**: Artificial
- **I**: Intelligent
- **K**: Knowledgeable
- **U**: Unmatched

We chose a Japanese name to symbolize precision, innovation, and advanced technology, attributes highly respected in Japanese culture. Even though we are based in Tunisia, we believe in global collaboration and the universal appeal and understanding of technology.

### What is PEAS?

PEAS stands for Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors. It's a framework used to describe the various components of an intelligent agent:

- **Performance Measure**: How well is the agent doing in its environment
- **Environment**: Where the agent operates
- **Actuators**: What actions the agent can take
- **Sensors**: How the agent perceives its environment

## Features

- Modular Design
- OpenAI GPT-4 Integration
- Extensible and Customizable

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/nooqta/saiku.git
```

Navigate to the project folder:

```
cd saiku
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Global Installation (Not Recommended Yet)

Although Saiku is available as an npm package, we are still in the early stages of development, and drastic changes to the architecture will occur. We don't recommend installing it globally yet. However, if you still wish to do so:

```
npm install -g saiku
```

## Usage

### Running the Project Locally

Before starting Saiku locally, build the project using the following command:

```
npm run build
```

To start the agent:

```
npm start
```

For automated building during development, use:

```
npm run watch
```

This will automatically build the project whenever files are changed, helping streamline the development process.
### Setting Up Environment Variables

Before running Saiku, configure the necessary environment variables. Copy the example environment file and then fill in the details.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to include your specific information:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=
DB_HOST=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_PASS=
EMAIL_USER=
DISPLAY_FROM_EMAIL=
USER=
COMPANY=
COUNTRY=
CITY=
PHONE=
```

### Command Line Options

Use Saiku with various options to tailor its operation to your needs:

```
Usage: saiku [options]

AI agent to help automate your tasks
```

#### Options:

```
  -v, --version                Output the current version
  -exec, --allowCodeExecution  Execute the code without prompting the user. (default: false)
  -h, --help                   Display help for command
```

For example, to allow code execution without prompting:

```
saiku -exec
```

## Future Features
